# Privacy Sandbox Web playbook

---

This repository, **Privacy Sandbox Web playbook**, is a collection of **demos** designed to illustrate both foundational **web privacy concepts** and the **technical usage** of various **Privacy Sandbox APIs**.

The goal is to help developers understand not just **how to use these APIs**, but also the underlying web mechanisms and challenges they address. Some demos focus on explaining web fundamentals, such as:

* What **cookies** are and how they're used.
* The distinction and implications of **first-party vs. third-party cookies**.
* Concepts like **partitioned storage** and how it enhances privacy.
* Common **attack vectors** related to cookies.
* The role and information conveyed by the **User-Agent string**.
* Usage of **Shared Storage API**.

Other demos in this playbook concentrate on showcasing the core interactions of the Privacy Sandbox APIs. We often simplify additional logic in these examples to keep the primary focus on the specific Privacy Sandbox features being demonstrated.
